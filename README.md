1. The Company has the higest sales in May 2020 for the year.
2. Product Category Clock is the best performing category both in reveneue and profit
3. Customer Team with high lifetime value should be targetted for marketing efforts
4. the City has the highest sales and revenue making the company generate more profit from there
5. Carlifornia has the higest sales and revenue.

### Recommendations

- Based on the Analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Investigate reasons for dips in February and March, replicate strategies that drove growth in April and May, and implement targets campaigns to sustain moments in the coming months
- Focus on strengthening sales for high-performing products (Clocks and Vases), improve strategies for low performers (Rugs and Wall Frames), and maintain consistency for mid-tier - products (Cookware, Ornaments, Phones).
- Enhance e-commerce platforms and digital marketing to further boost online sales.
- Develop tailored strategies to boost sales in Township and CDP.
- Target North Carolina with localized strategies to boost sales.
- Recognize top performers like Nicholas Cunningham, Donald Reynolds, and Joe Price. Support lower-performing teams (e.g., Patrick Graham) with additional resources, training, or motivation to help improve sales.

### Limitations

- I had to remove all two decimal points of the revenue and profit columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both profit and revenue.
